## Checkpoints
### overview
Model checkpoints used in the paper can be downloaded from [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u5RsCuZNf7ddWW0utI4OrgWGmJCUDCuT?usp=sharing).
Model training should be very easy with the provided training scripts. Better training techniques might further improvement model performance.

### checkpoints for bagnet/resnet trained on imagenette
- use pretrained model

### checkpoints for bagnet/resnet trained on imagenette
- resnet50.pth
- bagnet33.pth
- bagnet17.pth
- bagnet9.pth

### checkpoints for bagnet/resnet trained on cifar
- resnet50_192.pth
- bagnet33_192.pth
- bagnet17_192.pth
- bagnet9_192.pth

### checkpoints for ds-resnet on different datasets
- imagenet.pth
- imagenette.pth
- cifar.pth

Training scripts for ds-resnet are not provided in this repository, but can be found be found in [patchSmoothing](https://github.com/alevine0/patchSmoothing)
